# ChatScripts
Dump of scripts from Dev I should consider installing but don't have time to remember

The above, as well as I'm probably going to tweak some of them if I feel brave enough

Notably, I'd /only/ be tweaking them for myself

I'm thinking about fiddling with the CSS and making the (font-weight) for the (typing-indicator .username) italic instead of bold, (because I'm weird) as well as a few other *minimal* changes
