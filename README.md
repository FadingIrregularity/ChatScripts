# ChatScripts
Dump of scripts from Dev I should consider installing but don't have time to remember

The above, as well as I'm probably going to tweak some of them if I feel brave enough

Notably, I'd /only/ be tweaking them for myself

As far as IsTyping goes, I'm thinking about fiddling with the CSS and making the (font-weight) for the (typing-indicator .username) italic instead of bold, (because I'm weird) as well as a few other /minimal/ changes

For ChatOptions, I want to toss some of the more useless features and add some new ones. A font picker would be nice, probably a drop-down sort of thing, I also want to add some more fonts
